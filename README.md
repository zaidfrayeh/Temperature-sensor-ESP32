# Temperature-sensor-ESP32
this is a Temperature sensor which gives out Digital values on the console as well as LEDS depending on the temperature range 
21C and below turns on the orange LED 
between 22 and 25 green 
26 and above is red 
I used the ESP32 controller with MCP 9701 TEMPERATURE SENSOR
